# video-game-camp Day 1

*Design*

Write down the following in your notebook
  * Your game's title
  * What players will do within the game
    * What is the goal? How do you get points?
    * Is there a story to go along with your game?
    * What makes the game challenging?
  * At least 3 characters (including what they look like and any special powers they have)
  * At least 3 levels (what you have to do in each)

*Code*
  * Learn how to start the game
  * Learn how to edit the game's source code
  * Write function to determine whether bounding boxes overlap

*Test*

  * Play the game with and without the bounding-box overlap function defined.
  * Can you think how you would change the game to make actions occur when bounding boxes overlap?
