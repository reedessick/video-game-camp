# video-game-camp Day 2

*Design*

Find images online (or draw your own!) for the different characters and levels you described on Day 1.
Make sure to write down where you found your images in your notebook!

*Code*

  * Create your characters!
    * Define objects to represent your characters and their special powers. These should extend the BoundingBox class.
    * See if you can make the characters look like you designed them by including the pictures you drew!

*Test*

  * Building on the basic game from Day 1, add multiple characters to your game and see if you can make them do things when their bounding-boxes overlap.
  * Can you change which character you control?
  * Can you make multiple characters move at the same time?
