## Installation

This library relies upon pygame. On linux systems, this is simple to install with
```
sudo apt-get install python-pygame
```
This will discover and install the version of pygame consistent with your default Python interpreter. Mine happens to be Python2.7; yours is likely to be Python3.7 or higher.
